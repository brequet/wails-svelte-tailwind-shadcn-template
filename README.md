# Wails Svelte Tailwind Shadcn Template

This project is a comprehensive template for building desktop applications using Wails, Svelte, TailwindCSS, and Shadcn UI. It combines the power of Svelte for reactive UI components, TailwindCSS for utility-first styling, and Shadcn UI for additional UI components, all wrapped in a Wails application for easy cross-platform deployment.

## Features

- **Svelte**: Utilizes Svelte for its reactive UI components, making it easy to build dynamic and responsive interfaces.
- **TailwindCSS**: Leverages TailwindCSS for utility-first styling, allowing for rapid UI development with a consistent design system.
- **Shadcn UI**: Integrates Shadcn UI for additional UI components, enhancing the application's user interface with pre-designed components.
- **Wails**: Wraps the entire application in a Wails project, enabling easy cross-platform deployment to Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Getting Started

To get started with this template, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Build the Project**: From the project root directory, run `wails build` to build the application. This will compile the Svelte and TailwindCSS assets and prepare the application for deployment.
3. **Run the Application**: After building, you can run the application by executing the binary generated in the `build` directory.

## Development

For live development, you can run the application in development mode. This will enable hot-reloading, allowing you to see changes in real-time as you develop.

**Run Wails in Development Mode**: In a terminal, run `wails dev` from the project root directory to start the Wails application in development mode.
